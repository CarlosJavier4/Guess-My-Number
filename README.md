# Guess My Number (GAME)

[Visit me here](https://carlosjavier4.github.io/Guess-My-Number/)

This is a simple guessing game where the player has to guess a secret number. The game is played in a web browser and uses JavaScript events to interact with the DOM.

## How to Play

1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Enter a number in the input field and press the "Check!" button.
3. The game will give you a hint whether the entered number is greater or smaller than the secret number.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. Once you have guessed the number, a congratulations message will be displayed and you can restart the game by pressing the "Again" button.

## Learning JavaScript Events for DOM

During the development of this game, I learned how to use JavaScript events to interact with the DOM. Some of the concepts and techniques I used include:

- Using the addEventListener method to listen for click events on buttons.
- Manipulating HTML content using both the innerHTML and textContent properties.
- Modifying CSS styles using the style property.
- Getting and setting values of input elements using the value property.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements

While this game functions correctly, there are some improvements that could be implemented in future versions:

- Adding a limited number of attempts functionality to make the game more challenging.
- Enhancing the design and user experience with more attractive styles and animations.
- Implementing a multiplayer mode where players can compete to guess the secret number in the least amount of time.
